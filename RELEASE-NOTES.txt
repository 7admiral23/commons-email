                         Commons Email Package
                              Version 1.0
                             Release Notes

INTRODUCTION:

Commons-Email aims to provide a API for sending email. It builds on the JavaMail 
API with the aim of presenting a simplified API which is easy for developers who
are not mail experts to use. It is a compact component with a small number of
classes.

This is the first release of Commons Email. However, the codebase is mature and
stable and so this is no reason not to recommend it for production.
