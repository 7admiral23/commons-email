Commons-Email aims to provide a API for sending email.
It is built on top of the Java Mail API, which it aims to simplify.
All help is gratefully received.
</p>
<p>
Some of the mail classes that are provided are as follows:
<ul>
<li>
<b>SimpleEmail</b> -
This class is used to send basic text based emails.
</li>
<li>
<b>MultiPartEmail</b> -
This class is used to send multipart messages.
This allows a text message with attachments either inline or attached.
</li>
<li>
<b>HtmlEmail</b> -
This class is used to send HTML formatted emails.
It has all of the capabilities as MultiPartEmail allowing attachments to be easily added.
It also supports embedded images.
</li>
<li>
<b>EmailAttachment</b> -
This is a simple container class to allow for easy handling of attachments.
It is for use with instances of MultiPartEmail and HtmlEmail.

	<subsection name='Commons Email 1.0 (Release Candidate 6)'>
		<p>
Commons Email is (at long last) approaching it's first official release.
This may be the first official release of commons email but the code base
is already mature and stable. There is therefore no reason why this code
cannot be recommended for production.
		</p>
		<p>
The sixth release candidate is now available for
<a href='http://people.apache.org/~epugh/commons-email/'>download</a>

<section name="Development">
<p>Commons-Email may be used on any JRE from 1.3 onwards.</p>
<p>
  Please note that the tests may fail under JDK 1.3 due to the use of
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dumbster">Dumbster</a> which is compiled
  with JDK 1.4.
</p>
<p>
  Also note that on OS X you may need to use Dumbster 1.5, not Dumbster 1.6 to run
  the unit tests.  Just update the project.xml <i>dependency</i> element.
