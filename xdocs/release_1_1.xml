These are the release notes for Commons-Email version 1.1.
<source>
INTRODUCTION:

Commons-Email aims to provide a API for sending email. It builds on the JavaMail
API with the aim of presenting a simplified API which is easy for developers who
are not mail experts to use. It is a compact component with a small number of
classes.

This release includes several important fixes and enhancements, including
corrected MIME message construction, robust character set handling, and
MultiPartEmail message optimization. All users of Commons-Email 1.0 are
encouraged to upgrade.

REQUIREMENTS:

J2SE environments
-----------------

Commons-Email requires at least JDK 1.4.

Commons-Email requires at least JavaMail version 1.4. Get it
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/">here</a>.

Commons-Email also requires the Java Activation Framework through JavaMail.
Get it from <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javabeans/glasgow/jaf.html">here</a>.

Commons-Email has been tested with JDK 1.4.2_14, Java 1.5.0_11, and Java 1.6.0_01.

J2EE environments
-----------------

Commons-Email should be compatible with J2EE 5+ compliant
environments and run without additional requirements. Previous versions of
J2EE do not support the required versions of JavaMail and JAF, so they must be
specifically used in deployment.
