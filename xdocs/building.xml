<section name="Overview">
<p>
  Commons Email uses <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a> or
  <a href="http://ant.apache.org">Ant</a> as a build system.
</p>
<p>
  You may also be interested in the release notes:<br />

<section name="Maven Goals">
  <p>
    To build a jar file, change into Email's root directory and run "maven jar".
    The result will be in the "target" subdirectory.
  </p>
  <p>
    To build the Javadocs, run "maven javadoc".
    The result will be in "target/docs/apidocs".
  </p>
  <p>
    To build the full website, run "maven site".
    The result will be in "target/docs".
	You must be online and using JDK 1.4 or higher to successfully complete this target.
  </p>
  <p>
	Commons Email requires two jar files to compile and run - activation-1.0.2.jar and javamail-1.3.3.jar.
	These are not present in the main maven ibiblio repository due to Sun licensing restrictions.
	You must manually download these jars and install them in your own local repository.
  </p>
  <p>
	Sun Javamail, available from
	<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/">http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/</a><br />
	Sun Activation Framework, available from

<section name="Ant Goals">
  <p>
	A maven generated ant file is provided for ant users.
  </p>

<!-- ================================================== -->
<section name="Development">
  <p>
    Commons Email may be used on any JRE from 1.3 onwards.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please note that the tests may fail under JDK 1.3 due to the use of
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dumbster">Dumbster</a>
    which is compiled with JDK 1.4.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also note that on OS X you may need to use Dumbster 1.5, not Dumbster 1.6 to run
    the unit tests.  Just update the project.xml <i>dependency</i> element.
